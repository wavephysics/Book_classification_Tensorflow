# Book_classification_Tensorflow

A small code for book classification depending on the state of the book. The goal of this code propagrame is to train a neural network on a small ammount of data (images). Thereafter, we will try to see if the model detects any groove or dust on the book. Let us note that, the book covers were downloaded from the internet and the surface damage were inflicted using Paint (Windows software). Therefore, the surface damage is not physically done. The goal of the code is to detect whether the book is damaged or not.

The data is uploaded with the main code. Data is divided on 3 categories (training data, validation and Test data). Each of this folders contains separate folders of damaged and non-damaged books. To read and use the data, we make use of Tensorflow library.
